"""
Render QA helper — Phase 6 S2 (OFF by default, non-blocking).

Inspects a generated chart/report image for rendering defects using vision.
When vision is OFF (default) this module is a complete no-op.

Public API::

    verdict = await check_render(image_path)
    # Returns None when vision is off; RenderQAVerdict when on.

    verdict = await qa_and_log(image_path, context_label="005930")
    # Convenience wrapper: calls check_render and logs a warning on failure.
    # Never raises. Callers may ignore the return value.

Design constraints:
- analyze_image is imported at module level but is itself cheap to import
  (its heavy deps are lazy-loaded only when vision_available() is True).
- vision_available() is checked first; if False, returns None immediately.
- Never raises to caller. All errors return None silently.
- In shadow mode results are logged but never fed into trading decisions.

You are a chart rendering quality-assurance inspector. Your ONLY job is to \
detect visual rendering defects in the image. Do NOT analyse trading content, \
price trends, or financial signals.

Check specifically for these rendering defects:
1. Korean (Hangul) characters rendered as empty boxes (□□□) or garbled tofu glyphs.
2. Overlapping axis labels, tick labels, or legend entries that collide or are cut off.
3. Missing or blank axis tick marks / labels (e.g. empty X or Y axis).
4. Clipped or truncated text (text cut off at the chart border).
5. Legend boxes that overlap with chart content in a way that obscures data.
6. Blank, all-white, or corrupt image (no chart content visible at all).

Return a strict JSON object with these exact fields:
- ok (bool): true if no significant rendering defect found, false otherwise.
- issues (array of strings): list of specific defects found; empty array if none.
- severity (string): "none" if ok=true, "minor" for cosmetic issues, "major" for \
serious defects (tofu text, blank image, missing axes).
- confidence (integer 0-100): your confidence in this assessment.
- notes (string): one-sentence summary or "" if nothing to add.
