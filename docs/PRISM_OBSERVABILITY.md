## Contract

Trading processes append versioned JSON events to `logs/prism_events.jsonl`.
The append is fail-open and performs no network I/O. A separate shipper converts
events to OTLP/HTTP and advances its checkpoint only after a successful batch.

Required correlation fields:

- `event_id`, `event_type`, `timestamp`
- `trace_id`, `span_id`, optional `parent_event_id`
- optional `decision_id`, `position_id`
- `git_sha`, `policy_version`, `config_hash`
- `market`, `ticker`, `service`, `environment`

Sensitive attribute keys such as account, token, password, secret, cookie, and
authorization are replaced with `[REDACTED]` before the local append.

## Failure boundary

- ClickStack, network, tunnel, or shipper failure never blocks trading.
- Failed batches do not advance the checkpoint.
- One corrupt JSONL record is skipped and cannot block later records.
- ClickStack is not queried from any buy, sell, hard-stop, or fill path.

## Deployment topology

- `db-server`: PRISM pipeline, JSONL spool, shipper, SSH local-forward tunnel.
- `prism-backend`: resource-limited ClickStack container and an independent,
  token-authenticated ClickStack OTel Collector.
- ClickStack UI: backend localhost `18080`, proxied by authenticated Nginx `8443`.
- OTLP/HTTP: backend localhost `14318`, reachable from db-server only through SSH.

The tunnel target is supplied outside Git through
`/etc/prism-observability/tunnel.env` as `PRISM_BACKEND_HOST=...`.
The ingestion token is supplied outside Git through
`/etc/prism-observability/clickstack.env` as `OTLP_AUTH_TOKEN=...` and is also
configured on db-server as `PRISM_OBSERVABILITY_OTLP_TOKEN`.
The shipper sends this exact value in the `Authorization` header, matching the
ClickStack static bearer-token extension contract.
db-server loads the value from `/etc/prism-observability/shipper.env`, which
must remain mode `0600`.
The same environment file holds the dedicated `prism_otel` ClickHouse password;
only its SHA-256 hash is written to the mounted ClickHouse user configuration.
The XML user is restricted to the `default` observability database.
The mounted XML contains no plaintext password and must be readable by the
ClickHouse process (mode `0644`).

## Trading context ledger

- `deployment.applied`
- `trigger.performance_feedback`
- `market.regime_snapshot` (live on every computed KR/US regime observation)
- `candidate.evaluated`
- `candidate.outcome` (live when 30-day tracking completes)
- `screening.third_slot_shadow_evaluated` (KR weak-regime 2-vs-3 candidates)
- `screening.third_slot_shadow_outcome` (exact 1/3/5/10 trading-day returns)
- `entry.executed`
- `entry.fill_reconciled` (US CAPTURE: 제출과 실제 체결을 구분하는 주문 provenance)
- `exit.executed`

`candidate.evaluated`, `entry.executed`, and `exit.executed` use context schema
version 1. The entry scenario keeps the authoritative deterministic market
snapshot, security trend facts, gate findings, score adjustments, and portfolio
slot state. `decision_id` links the candidate to the entry, `position_id` links
entry to exit, and a stable `trace_id` ties the complete lifecycle together.

The exit snapshot uses the live computed market context when available and
falls back to the latest local regime-history row without network I/O. Long
reports and prompts are not copied into ClickHouse; the event retains the
structured decision facts and source identifiers needed for reconstruction.
Every append remains fail-open and happens only after the simulator database
transaction has committed.

US `candidate.evaluated` events may include versioned `entry_quality_context`
when `ENTRY_QUALITY_CAPTURE_ENABLED` is not explicitly disabled. The capture is
enabled by default; setting the variable to `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off` is the
single kill switch. It uses only the existing scenario and local trigger
feedback tables. Missing daily/weekly base or structured event evidence remains
`MISSING`, and broker acceptance remains `SUBMITTED_ONLY` until an authoritative
fill source confirms it.

Entry-quality analysis must be derived with
`tools/build_entry_quality_evidence_packet.py` from a local sanitized JSONL
export. The tool performs no network or database access, excludes legacy and
backfill candidates from prospective evidence, deduplicates event and decision
identities, enforces exact `decision_id`/`position_id` joins, and emits explicit
coverage, missingness, fill, linkage, leakage, cohort, and insufficiency facts.
Future sessions should use `skills/prism-entry-quality-analysis/SKILL.md` rather
than ad-hoc SQL. The packet never enables SHADOW or LIVE behavior.

KR weak-regime third-slot analysis remains outside the candidate-performance
tables so it cannot influence trigger priors or trading prompts. The screening
event stores the unchanged live ranks 1 and 2 beside the counterfactual rank 3.
`tools/track_third_slot_shadow.py` later appends exact 1/3/5/10 KRX trading-day
close, MFE, and MAE outcomes. `tools/build_third_slot_evidence_packet.py`
deduplicates and compares these cohorts without claiming fills or account PnL.

## Historical baseline

tools/backfill_observability.py backfills only verifiable facts:

- realized KR/US rows from the production trading-history tables
- completed watched-candidate 7/14/30-day outcomes
- recorded regime snapshots
- actual db-server pull timestamps from Git reflog

Every row is marked ingestion_mode=backfill, includes its source table or
reflog provenance, and receives a deterministic event ID. Historical prompts,
gates, and decision traces are not reconstructed.

## Curated dashboard snapshot

tools/export_observability_insights.py aggregates ClickHouse events into a
credential-free JSON snapshot. tools/publish_observability_insights.py
publishes it atomically to app-server every five minutes through the systemd
timer template.

The publisher uses a dedicated SSH identity and the unprivileged prism account
on app-server. Host, port, user, identity path, and destination stay outside Git
in /etc/prism-observability/dashboard-export.env.

The existing dashboard reads /observability_insights.json independently from
its portfolio JSON. Missing or delayed observability data hides only the new
panel and never breaks the existing dashboard.

### Local dashboard (localhost)

A local dashboard can use its own event spool without ClickHouse or SSH:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/export_observability_insights.py \
  --input logs/prism_events.jsonl \
  --output examples/dashboard/public/observability_insights.json
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/?tab=insights` and select KR or US. The observation
panel labels this source as a local snapshot and shows its export time. The
snapshot contains aggregates, not raw prompts or credentials. Entry-quality
coverage starts at the first captured context; older candidate records are
counted separately and do not become quality samples retroactively.

For automatic updates, add `--observability-input logs/prism_events.jsonl` to
existing `examples/generate_dashboard_json.py` cron commands (the US generator
supports the same option). On the local host these run weekdays at 11:05 and
17:10 KST. Each export includes both markets from that host's spool. Disabled
US jobs do not need to be enabled. Without the option, the existing ClickHouse
publication path remains unchanged.

Export runs before portfolio generation. Missing or unreadable input preserves
the last good snapshot and does not stop portfolio updates. Malformed lines and
an incomplete append tail are excluded with diagnostic counts; wholly invalid
input fails without replacing the previous snapshot. Writes use unique temporary
files and atomic replacement. Restart the Next.js service after first creating
a previously absent public file. This connection displays observations only;
it does not promote or execute entry rules.

## Rollback

1. Stop and disable `prism-observability-shipper` and tunnel units.
2. The trading pipeline continues; local event appends remain harmless.
3. Stop ClickStack with `docker compose down` without deleting its volumes.
4. Remove the Nginx `8443` site and firewall rule if external UI access is no
   longer needed.
